This repository contains the code for our timetabling problem. We've also uploaded two datasets that can be used to run the code. 
In order to run the code, you have to read the dataset for the semester of interest. We've also included a line of code called  V_ew, which can be used to filter for the week of interest. We did this because of the computational cost of the model.
